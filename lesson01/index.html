                <h1>Hi, I am Laura Guerrero</h1>
                <h2>An experience creator</h2>
                <p>I'm a creative and versatile professional from Spain with a background in graphic and web design. After studying Interactive Graphics and working in the design field for several years in Barcelona, I felt the pull to explore the world and grow on a personal level. That journey took me from the mountains of Northern California through Latin America, where I volunteered in hostels, worked on organic farms, and sailed on private boats—always finding ways to bring my love for design and photography along for the ride.</p>

                 <p> These experiences deepened my love for travel, culture, and human connection.</p>
                    
                <p>Eventually, I made California my home and lived in the mountains for a few years. After embracing a multifaceted lifestyle, I'm now based in San Diego, refreshing my skills in web development and UX/UI design as I get ready to return to the tech world with a fresh perspective and renewed enthusiasm.</p>
                    
                <p>   Passionate, adaptable, and curious, I'm excited to find opportunities where I can blend my creative background with my love for travel, technology, and continuous learning.</p>

            <h2>My experience</h2>
            <p>My experience in web development started alongside my graphic design studies, while I was also working in design and web for small companies.</p>
            <p>
                I studied Graphic Design and Interactive Graphics in Barcelona several years ago. After graduating, I worked primarily as a graphic designer, but I was also deeply involved in web design projects, especially focusing on layout using HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>After spending some years living a more multifaceted lifestyle, I decided to reconnect with the tech world. So, last year, I joined a Front-End Development BootCamp to refresh my skills. During the course, I revisited HTML and CSS, got more comfortable with frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap—which I had used before but hadn't fully mastered—and began learning the basics of JavaScript. I also got my first look at Vue.js.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm continuing to grow as a front-end developer, combining my creative background with up-to-date coding skills—and really enjoying the process.

                <p>The thing I enjoy most is TRAVEL! It has taught me so much about life and people. I also love sharing my life with my dog—a 4.5-year-old German Shepherd named Ohana. Ohana means family, and she truly is my family here since I moved from Spain. I enjoy doing anything outdoors, I and I also love dancing and electronic music.</p>
